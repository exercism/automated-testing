# Introduction to Test Runners

A _Test Runner_ is a piece of software that runs a solution's tests once it's submitted.

Test runners give us two advantages:

1. They enable in-browser coding, where a student can iterate on a solution seeing whether the tests pass or fail.
1. They allow us to provide information to mentors on whether a student's code "works" or not.

Each language has its own test runner. The Exercism website acts as the orchestrator between the test runners and the submissions.
